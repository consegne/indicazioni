				<h6> As a little boy in oxford, i was encouraged to worship the mind.

				<p> We learned how to write with spurious fluency on every aspect of plato or king lear, and the less we knew, the more commandingly we could write. The mind became an instrument we could deploy as sword, shield and moat; on its own terms – and they were the only terms we were taught to honour – it was impossible to defeat. But then – of course – after twenty years of reciting irregular verbs and parsing aeschylus – i ventured out into the larger world, and found that almost everything that mattered hadn’t been covered in my classroom: that slant of light coming through the chapel window; my senseless terror of the woods; that girl smiling at me from the shadows, all the confounding emotions her smile awakened.<br>
				My parents had moved to california by then, and one hot midsummer evening, visiting the family home, i looked up and saw a slash of orange racing down a distant mountain slope. I went downstairs to call the fire department, and by the time i returned upstairs, five minutes later, flames were all around our house, moving at seventy miles per hour and rising three stories above the wooden frame. I jumped into a car, but within less than a minute found myself stranded on our mountain road, unable to move for three hours, as the fire up above started picking through every room in the house and reduced everything we owned in the world, every last scrap of paper and souvenir, to ash.
				Marcus aurelius had given me all kinds of wisdom for dealing with loss – impeccable in theory – and shakespeare’s julius caesar had taught me about the fury of the irrational. But when i thought of texts like that, i was back in the mind of my schoolboy days, and that was the structure that now lay in rubble.
